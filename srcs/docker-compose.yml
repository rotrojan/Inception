# The default volume driver on linux is `local`.
# Others drivers allow to save the volume on the cloud, do encryption, etc.
# The options are specific to the driver.
# The built-in `local` driver on Linux accepts options similar to the linux `mount(8)` command.

# The default driver for networks creation is `bridge`.
# Docker-compose automatically creates a network to allow containers to communicate with each others.
# However, creating a user-defined network presents several advantages uppon the default one:
# - automatic DNS resolution between containers using the container's name (`ping <container_name>`);
# - better isolation (all containers without a network specified are attached to the default bridge network);
# - containers can be attached and detached from user-defined networks on the fly;
# - each user-defined network creates a configurable bridge;
# - linked containers on the default bridge network share environment variables.
